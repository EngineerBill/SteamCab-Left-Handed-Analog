SteamCab-Left-Handed-Analog
===========================


About:
------

The Steamchest Chronicle's first foray into the world of Pebble Watchface design.

Our initial investigations into the world of Pebble programming focused on
understanding the structure and requirements for a working Watchface app.
After studying a number of examples and reviewing what was already out there,
we decided to roll our own. The result was the 'SteamCab Left Handed Analog - Mark I',
a "counter-revolutionary" approach to analog watch design...


This project began life as the example "simple_analog" example watch in
thePebble SDK. The original was modified to provide counterclockwise hand
movement and a new layer containing a text string. We then made an annotation
pass through the source code to help those who would follow.

The changes to convert to counterclock operation are quite minor, but the
project served to teach the basic structure of a watchface app and the steps
needed to add and display a TextBox to a window. 


You can find the original example source code in the SDK
watches directory:

       "SDK-1.12->Pebble->watches->simple_analog".
